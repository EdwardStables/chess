# Chess

This is a python library, server, and web interface that implements chess. I'm making this to get familiar with pytest, flask, and simple web development. The intention is for this to be easily connected to from many clients, enabling easy programming of chess AIs.

## State

Current state is :

- Moving works correctly
- Simple web interface works well
- Decent amount of test coverage

Known issues (hopefully to be fixed in the coming days):

- Taking pieces doesn't work (although the web interface might give the impression that it does), this also means there's no way to win
- The interface is very ugly, I intend for this to improve as I learn more web design

## Interface

The beautiful web interface:
